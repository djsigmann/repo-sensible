# RepoSensible
A modpack containing various quality of life fixes and improvements for [R.E.P.O.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241660/REPO/)
I want this to be a modpack nobody objects to installing. [Let me know](https://github.com/djsigmann/repo-sensible/issues) if you have any objections to anything or feel this modpack is missing something.

Some of these mods, while useful, would differ from vanilla too much, so I've decided to include them in the modpack but configured to a disabled/default state.
All mod configs are kept at their defaults, except for:
- FPSCounter - Disabled and size is half of the original
- FovUpdate - FOV set to 90 and other options scaled to this value; aspect ratio fix enabled
- DarkRepo - Configured to be the same as the vanilla game
- Toggle_Mute - Disabled
- EnhancedControls - Disabled stand after crouch jump

Unless otherwise specified, all configs can be edited in-game under the Mods section.
